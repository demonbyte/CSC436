        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at DePaul University. I have experience as a developer in Java, and have worked with both UI and backend development. In my free time, I enjoy reading and watching series.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I'm also interested in learning new things and developing my skills. I'm excited to be part of the DePaul community and to learn from my professors and classmates.

            I'm also excited to share my knowledge and experience with others. I'm always happy to help others learn new things and to develop their skills.

            I'm looking forward to connecting with other people who are interested in technology and computer science. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you'd like to chat.
        </p>
